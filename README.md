# Greek Life at Union College: A Century of Change

This project explores the evolution of Greek Life at Union College over 120 years (1880–2000) using archival data from the Concordiensis newspaper. By analyzing sentiment trends, linguistic patterns, and key descriptors, it provides insights into the changing perceptions of fraternities, sororities, and the broader Greek system on campus.

## **Overview**

Union College has played a pivotal role in the history of Greek Life as the "Mother of Fraternities." This project leverages text data from the Concordiensis archives to examine:

- Sentiment trends toward Greek Life over time.
- Key adjectives and language shifts associated with fraternities and sororities.
- The evolution of campus narratives and culture.

By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including sentiment analysis and word cloud generation, this analysis uncovers how Greek Life shaped Union College's culture and vice versa.
